# 📌 Facial-Expressions-Recognition
Deep Learning-based Flask web app that predicts the Facial Expressions of users in real time, by image or image url.

## ◉ In this project the Model can take input through following ways :

##### 1- Real-time Video input 

##### 2- Upload Images from your pc  

##### 3- Enter image URL

## ◉ The objectives of the project are as follows:

• Import the required Packages and Libraries. 

• explore the dataset FER-2013.

• Data analysis,Data Augmentation and Creating Training and Validation Batches.  

• Create a CNN using 4 Convolutional Layers including Batch Normalization, Activation, Max Pooling, Dropout Layers followed by Flatten Layer, 2 Fully Connected dense Layers and finally Dense Layer with SoftMax Activation Function.    

• Compile the model using Adam Optimizer and categorical cross entropy loss function.   

• Training the model for 15 epochs and then Evaluating the model as well as saving the model Weights in .h5 Value.  

• Saving the model as JSON string.   

• create a Flask app to serve predictions. 

• design an HTML templates for the Flask app.  

• Finally we can use the model to recognize facial expressions by real time video ,from image or by image url.
